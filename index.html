    <h1>Hello! My name is Yihui.</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>I'm a sophomore, majoring in <strong>Computer Science.</strong></p>
    <p>My IP address is 130.64.225.2.</p>
    <p>I grew up in Singapore, a very tiny island in Southeast Asia.</p>
    <p>A few, maybe surprising things about myself:
    <ul>
        <li>I was previously trained in the fine arts.</li>
        <li>I used to do wushu and breakdance.</li>
        <li>I have three other siblings.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>One of my favourite places to frequent is East Coast Park in Singapore. Cycling there is very fun.</p>
